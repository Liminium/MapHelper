MapHelper is a pet project that was made for convenient work with world maps at a professional level. 

The main technologies used that underlie its operation are PyQt5 and the YandexMaps API. QSS was chosen as the language for creating the interface. 
Development began in 2022 (when the author was 16 years old) as a hobby, and since then the project has undergone many changes, but has not been supplemented recently.
